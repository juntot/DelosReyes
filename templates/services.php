							<h4><label>Color Deficiency Screening</label></h4>
							Color vision problems are usually associated
							with genetics. People can live their
							whole lives without realizing they have
							problems with color perception, therefore
							it’s important to have your color vision
							checked regularly as it may even help in
							diagnosing underlying diseases like diabetes
							and even macular degeneration. Certain
							occupations also require good color
							vision, like medical technologists and
							seamen

							<h4><label>Intraocular Pressure Check</label></h4>
							Glaucoma or ocular hypertension is one of
							the leading causes of blindness all over the
							world and is often associated with nearsightedness.
							It’s important to check and
							monitor the pressure inside your eyes to
							rule out this condition through a tonometer.
							Because we at De Los Reyes care, this
							service is available at all branches.
